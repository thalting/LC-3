# LC-3
A [ Little Computer 3 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) written in Zig

## Description
> Little Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language.

> It features a relatively simple instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs, and is a viable target for a C compiler. The language is less complex than x86 assembly but has many features similar to those in more complex languages. These features make it useful for beginning instruction, so it is most often used to teach fundamentals of programming and computer architecture to computer science and computer engineering students.

> The LC-3 was developed by Yale N. Patt at the University of Texas at Austin and Sanjay J. Patel at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Their specification of the instruction set, the overall architecture of the LC-3, and a hardware implementation can be found in the second edition of their textbook.[1] Courses based on the LC-3 and Patt and Patel's book are offered in many computer engineering and computer science departments.
